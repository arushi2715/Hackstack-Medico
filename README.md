### üí° Inspiration

<ul>
<li>The past two years have been a testimony to the fact that the medical sector still lacks in proper mitigation and tending to needs of patients of all backgrounds, in the face of disasters like pandemics. Millions of people were locked in their homes, thus restricitng smooth offline access to hospitals and healthcare centers.</li>

<li>Medico is an attempt at solving these persisting problems by ensuring a smooth transition of the medical sector network and its workings to digital platforms. Doctors and patients get to connect on a singular platform, just a few clicks away.</li>
</ul>

### üöÄ Features

<ul>
<li>The users get to access various links and functionalities of the website here, right from understanding through 'About Us' to signing up on the website.</li>

<li>The website can be used as either a doctor, or a patient. Their dashboards can give them an overview of the medical history, medicines, and appointments booked so far.</li>

<li>In case of medical emergencies, patients get to book an appointment with the doctor, where they can choose from certified doctors to get prescribed by.</li>

<li>A BMI calculator has been incorporated, through which users can get a measure of their body fat based on height and weight.</li>

<li>Our website is committed to security of the users, which we have achieved by using JWT and storing hashed passwords. To ensure the right data is provided to us, we have validation checks on the frontend and the backend.</li>
</ul>

### üß∞ Built With

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Material-UI](https://mui.com/)

### ‚ùì Challenges we ran into

<ul>
<li>No one was very much familiar with react, so this was our chance to showcase and polish our react and frontend skills. We tried to make a decent frontend in such a short interval of time.</li>

<li>We managed to build the frontend and backend from scartch to finish, but connecting tand deploying was quite tricky.</li>
</ul>

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

### üèÜ Accomplishments

<ul>
<li>Despite hectic schedules and time crunch, our team managed to successfully finish all the planned tasks for the frontend and backend features of the website, well in time. Both are running smoothly individually.</li>
</ul>

### üß† What we learnt

<ul>
<li>Building a full stack website was a new yet exciting challenge for us, but once we got the hang of it, we divided the tasks and collaborated efficiently.</li>

<li>We worked with a few packages and libraries for the first time, like Material UI, Chart.js, etc. The BMI calculator component had to be built from scratch.</li>
</ul>

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

### ü§î Future Scope

<ul>
<li>Health and lifestyle related blogs for the readers among our users.</li>

<li>Adding chemists to the website, so that the added burden of traveling huge distances for medicines gets reduced for the patients.</li>

<li>Trackers and reminders for patients to remind them to take their medicines at prescribed intervals and dosages.</li>
</ul>
